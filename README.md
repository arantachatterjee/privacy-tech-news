This repository points to a public content website I created in 2016 as part of a behavioural research-oriented project aimed at tracking visitor activity on the content website. The site has Google Analytics enabled and tracks all things that Google Analytics won't track for you (using PHP and plain old fashioned JavaScript). Collected data is stored in MySQL for further analysis.

On modern browsers, you may receive a "site unsafe" warning due to expired SSL certificate and the PHP and JS in the website's source code that tracks your IP address and clicks throughout your interactions with the websites, including capturing how much time you spent on each web page you clicked. The tracking is bening and for research purposes only.
