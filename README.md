This repository points to a public content website I created in 2016 as part of a behavioural-research project. This project was aimed at tracking and analyzing visitor activity. The site has Google Analytics enabled and also tracks all the granular stuff that Google Analytics won't track for you (using PHP and plain old fashioned JavaScript). Collected data is stored in MySQL for further analysis.

On modern browsers, you may receive a "site unsafe" warning due to expired SSL certificate and the PHP and JS in the website's source code that tracks your IP address and clicks throughout your interactions with the websites, including capturing how much time you spent on each web page you clicked. The tracking is benign and for research purposes only.
